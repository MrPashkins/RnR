Hi there! Welcome to my first app ever created on ruby on rails, that actually got away from my computer all the way up to github and heroku.
Here some clear instructions:
1. When you open it, don't be scared. It has everything it needs and nothing else(a lot of space for some adds). You can either pull it from github, or just go to this address: https://blog-task.herokuapp.com/
2. You are on the main page right now. Under the main title we have couple links and a list of already created "posts-articles", each of them has some options you can try.
3.  You get some options to operate with. You see that underlined "New article" link - that is what you want to create new article in this amazing blog. Press it and a window pops up. You can't create new post unless you are a blogger. So go ahead and type:
login: bloger
pass: qwerty
4. Now let's go to the "search" section. We'll get to articles' options later. You can use search and it will return you any article that contains the combination of any symbols you've put in the search-line, only if there are such combinations in our posts. If there is none - you won't see anything. To go back to the list of articles - hit "To the articles" link.
5. Now let's talk about articles. You can edit the ones we already have using the same id and pass, u can delete them and you can look through them by pressing "Show". There you can read other visitors' comments or leave or delete yours.
Sooooo...basically that is it. I hope you've enjoyed it as much as I did=)
